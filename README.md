~ This is a Simple Web Chat Application using Nodejs,HTML,CSS & JS.
~ Not fully Developed yet.

⚠️ HERE are some Remainders for me !

~ Database should be created to manage the User-ids, Passwords and other data.
~ Welcome (Login/Signup) page will be uploaded soon.
~ Note : While running node index.js , it will initially point to that Welcome Page.
~ If they've already logged in, the index.js will point to their Homepage/Chats Section.
~ Chats history will be maintained locally via HTML & Nodejs but the Database should also capture those kinda things for Server Reference.
~ Sessions should be created for Users' login.
~ Change the whole Directory and file locations for better Integration.
~ Microphone option should be added to the Chat pages.
~ Add Send button Hover/Click lighting event for windows.
~ ⚠️ This one has the Mobile-Oriented version alignment ( Landscape Version should be created ).
~ Changes should be made in all the pages for Better UI Experience.
~ It has only Sender-Side Backend codes; Receiver Side Backend ( Nodejs ) has to be Created.
~ Additional features may be added as our own needs.
~ A Window onload function must be added which do refer Database for the Past Chats to the Homepage/Chats page because it has only the Dynamic 'div' creation system which leads to Data Deletion after a Session.
~ Packages should be created and 'npm' account ought to be created for Usage of this application in the Web Server side.
~ Dark/Light themes Options have to be added for the better UI Preference.
~ ⚠️ ADMIN application should be created for the management of all the DATA that access Database and should have Administrator Privileges and Authorities.
~ Database should be wide enough because it would be more than one networks.
~ ❗ Swipe lock ( A Beta feature ) will be uploaded for use.
